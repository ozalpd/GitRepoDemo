# Documentation for the cherry-pick command in Git.
#
# The cherry-pick command is used to apply the changes of a specific commit onto the current branch.
# It allows you to select a single commit from another branch and apply it to the current branch, 
# effectively bringing the changes from that commit into your current branch's history.
#
# Usage: git cherry-pick <commit>
#
# Parameters:
#   - <commit>: The commit hash or reference of the commit you want to cherry-pick.
#
# Example:
#   git cherry-pick abc123
#
# This will apply the changes from the commit with hash "abc123" onto the current branch.
#
# Note: Cherry-picking a commit can result in conflicts if the changes in the commit conflict with 
# the changes in the current branch. In such cases, manual resolution of conflicts is required.
